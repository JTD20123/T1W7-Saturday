# Wildcard Arguments
- When you don't know how many arguments to pass in a function
- Non-keyword arguments, *args
- Keyword arguments, **kwargs

# Modules
- One of the techniques for following DRY Coding Principles
- Group similar codes and functions together in a separate file
- Solves the problem of code file being too lengthy and complex
- Can be reused across several programs
- Python comes with a lot of modules as well, Pythons standard Library
